# Sorting-Algorithms-visualizer

This project provides a user interface for visualizing different sorting algorithms. Users can observe various sorting algorithms in real-time and gain a better understanding of how the algorithms work.

User can enter his desired list of number or can just let the app make random data .


## Requirement
1-Python 3.9 or higher

2-PyQt6 library 

3-Numpy library

4-Matplotlip Library

## Used Algorithms 
Insertion Sort ,Selection Sort ,Quick Sort ,Merge Sort ,Bubble Sort 

## Used Plot Types 
Stem Plot,Scatter Plot , Bar Plot 

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1-Clone the repository to your local machine.

2-Install the required dependencies.

3-Run the main application file to launch the sorting algorithm visualization interface.
